# Data Directory

This folder holds example datasets for reproducible backtests.

- `raw/`: small, public or synthetic input datasets (CSV/Parquet)
- `processed/`: generated artifacts, caches, and analysis outputs

Guidelines:
- Keep `raw/` samples small (<1 MB) and licensed (CC BY, public domain, or synthetic).
- Do not commit confidential or proprietary market data.
- Use deterministic seeds and scripts (see `scripts/generate_sample_data.py`) to reproduce results.

License & Attribution:
- Synthetic data is generated by this repository and may be used freely under MIT project terms.
- If you add real datasets, include source attribution and license details here.
